# SwimmingPool
This project demonstrates a simple simulation written in Java: calculating the time required to fill a swimming pool, given the filling speed of water and the drainage (devastation) speed.
Description
The program models a pool with the following conditions:
Total pool volume: 1200 liters
Filling speed: 30 liters per minute
Drainage speed: 10 liters per minute
The simulation calculates how many minutes are required to completely fill the pool while accounting for the simultaneous drainage process.
When the pool is full, the program prints the result:
время наполнения бассейна составит: X мин.
How It Works
The program starts with an empty pool (volumeNow = 0).
On each iteration (representing one minute):
Water is added at the filling speed.
Water is drained at the devastation speed.
The time counter is incremented until the pool reaches its maximum volume.
The total time is displayed in minutes.
Usage
Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Run
Compile and run the program from the terminal:
javac Main.java
java Main
Output Example
время наполнения бассейна составит: 60 мин.
